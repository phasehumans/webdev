# JavaScript

- https://projects.100xdevs.com/tracks/javascript-1/Javascript-101-2

- browser only understand html, css, js and webassembly (c++/rust <-- wasm)
- interpreted: js code -----> runs on machine
  - code runs line by line (chunks)
  - compile at runtime
- compiled: c++ / java code ----> binary code ---> runs on machine
- dynamically typed: change datatype
- single threaded
- garbage collector

## Variable
- let: can update and redeclare
- const: can't update and redeclare
- var is not used (hoisting err | fn scope err), undefine is use before initalize

## Input & Output
- console.log("text")
- console.log(`text is here ${var} another text here`)
- prompt() --> inbrowser
- process.stdin.setEncoding('utf8'): This line sets the encoding for the standard input to UTF-8. It ensures that the input is treated as a UTF-8 encoded string, which is a common character encoding.
- process.stdin.on('data', function (input) {: This line sets up an event listener for the 'data' event on the standard input stream. The provided callback function will be executed whenever data is received on the standard input.

 
## DataTypes

### Primitive
- immutable
- call by value - copy of data, changes are in copy

1. Number
2. String
3. Boolean
4. Undefined
5. Null
6. Symbol -> used to create unique indetifiers
7. bigInt

### Non-Primitive / Reference
- mutable
- call by ref - direct ref of memory address

1. Object -> collection of key value pair  { }
2. Array -> [ ]



## Operators
1. arithmetic: + - * / % **
2. comparision: < > >= <= == ===(strict check) !=
3. logical: && (and), || (or), !(not)
4. bitwise: & | ! ^ (XOR)
5. assign: =
6. nullish coalescing: ?? returns RH value when LH is null


## Memory in JS
- stack(primitive: num, str, bool, null, undefine) -> copy is pass || call by value || immutable
- heap(non primitive: array, object) -> ref is pass || call by ref || mutable

### Stack
- ref variable are stored w/ memory address
### Heap
- actual data is stored and unique memory address is given


- primitive -> separte address and ref var
- non primitive: obj1 ---->  memoy_address <------ obj2; so one change then another also gets change


## String
- used to hold data that is represented in text form
- immutable
- call by value
- console.log(str.__proto__)  // {}
- console.log(str.__proto__.__proto__)  // [Object: null prototype] {}

#### Methods
- function tied to class(in this case String Class) are called methods
- str[index] --> access char  
- str.charat(index) --> acces char
- length  
- toUpperCase()  
- toLoweCase()
- indexof("value")
- inclues("value") --> T/F
- slice(start,end)
- replace("old", "new")
- trim() --> remove spaces
- split(separator, limit)
- repeat(interval)
- concat(" ", str2) --> join two str; str1 + str2


## Array
- used to store multi values in single var
- dynamic and hetro elmt
- mutable and pass by ref

#### Methods
- push() --> add at last
- unshift() --> add at first 
- pop() --> remove last emlt
- shift() --> remove first elmt
- indexof() --> returns index of search emlt (-1)
- findindex() -->  returns the index
- includes() --> T/F
- foreach() --> iterate over array, modify og
- map() --> iterate, not modify og  
array.map(callback(element, index, array), thisArg);
- reduce --> reduce arr to single value and return single value
- filter() --> return filter arr based on condn, not change og
- sort() --> sort
- reverse() --> reverse, modify og
- flat(infinity)  --> merge subarrays
- conact(newarr)  --> add arr
- find()
- findLast()
- findLastIndex()
- join()  --> joins and return as str
- slice()
- toSpliced() --> similar to slice, no chnage in og
- ...names to collect any additional names into an array.



## Object
- collection of key value pair 
- Objects --> Represent Properties, Methods[Functionalities]
- Properties -->  Attribute: Color, weight etc.
- Method -->  Actions, functions
- Even with const, only the reference is fixed — the contents are still changeable (const obj1 = {})


## Function
- reusable block of code
- Arrow function: consise way to write fn  
- IFFE: Immediately Invoked Function Expression : execute immediately after defination  
- higher order fn: fn that take another fn as argument ex. promise
- call back fn: function that you pass as an argument to another function so that the receiving function (higher order fn) can call it back at a later time.
- recursive fn: fn calls itself
- .this ->  bind to obj (instance of class not object) that call fn 
- arrow fn has lexical scoping, Arrow functions inherit this from their surrounding scope, while regular functions define their own this context.
- functional argument: passing a fn to another fn as an argument (sync)
- callback: similar but w/ async code

scope:
- global scope
- local scope : inside {}


## Control Flow
- conditionals
- iteration / loop

### Conditionals
- if = agar ye condition true hai
- else if = warna agar dusri condition true hai
- else = sab galat ho gaya toh ye karo

Ternary: condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse;  

Switch: used to test one variable or expression against multiple possible values  
- break
- default
- case

### Loops
- for 
- while 
- dowhile
- for of(arr, map, string)
- for in(obj)

array specific
- for each
- filter ---> filter returns value(arr) that satisfy condn
- map 
- reduce -> array.reduce(callback, initialValue)

## ES6+

### Shallow copy & Deep copy
- shallow copy {...} only copies the top-level of an object
- spread opt {...a , ...b} --> b will overide a prop
- obj1 = obj2 --> ref passing
- user also got changed; pass by ref, soln-> spread opt
- a= {...b} spread operator 
- but for nested obj, spread is shallow copy
- why -> primitive → copied by value. & object → copied by reference
- soln --> deep copy (serialization (obj -> str) - deserialization)

## Async 
- sync code: runs line by line. each operation wait for the prev operation to execute before moving to next
- I/O operations: input- output opeartions that req, data transfer and waiting time like calls to db, network calls, disks, clocks, external devices
- fs library (access file system)
- io bound tasks (readfile etc)
- cpu bond task (loops , condn)
- http://latentflip.com/loupe/  (visualize async code)
- this: has context of current obj, it has current obj
- new: creates the instance of class

### Hoisting
- mechanism where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase, before the code is executed. However, only the declarations are hoisted—not the initializations.

- var  -> undefined
- let and const  -> referror (hoist but Temporal dead zone)
- Block Scope (let and const): Variables declared with let and const are limited to the block where they are defined. Example: Inside a loop or conditional block.
- Function Scope (var): Variables declared with var are limited to the nearest function. If declared outside any function, they become global variables


### Prototype
- object from which other objects inherit properties and methods
- prototype based inheritance system
- Object.prototype = {}
- obj1._ _proto_ _= Object.prototype
- Array.prototype= {properties / methods}
- arr._proto_ = Array.prototype ---> Array has parent class and arr has child class
- proto chaining --> obj2._ proto _ = obj1 
- eveything is obj in js --> arr.proto.proto = obj , str.proto.proto= obj



### Polyfills
- fallback mechanism
- custom methods if prototype methods doesn't supported by browser
- methods like -> .map, .filter, .reduce


### Inner working
- call stack (execute immediate & clear stack)
- callback queue (browser -> que -> call stack) codn: stack empty
- call stack ---> browser (register & start timer) --> callback queue  or micro task queue--> (event loop) --> call stack (execute)
- undefine var err - bind(context)
- micro task queue >> callback queue / task queue
- starvation - infinite popup task in MTQ 
- global execution context (GEC) is pushed in stack
- memory phase: all var loaded w/ undefine and fn defn
- exectuion phase: var values added, fn's FEC is execcuted

### Promises
- promise class gives you a promise, that i will return you something in the future
- obj that represent eventual result of async opt
- to avoid callback hell
- promise- pending, fullfilled, rejected
- .then() .catch() .finally()

### Callback hell
- async code inside the asyc code
- nested callbacks or nested async operations

### Async/Await
- write async code that looks and behave like sync code 
- syntactic sugar on top of promise


### Lexical Scoping & Closures
- lexical: the scope of var is detrmine by where it is written, not by where its called from
- access of var in scope
- closure fn: fn that has access to the var of its outer fn, even after outer fn has finished execution
- fn returning fn w/ lexical scope binded


### Destructing
- pull values from arrays or objects into separate variables
- in array based on order, obj based on name
- const colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
- const [primary, secondary, tertiary] = colors;


## DOM
- DOM = Document Object Model, represents HTML as objects  
- Allows JS to read, change, add, or remove elements and content  
- Access elements:
  - `getElementById("id")` → single element by ID  
  - `getElementsByClassName("class")` → HTMLCollection  
  - `getElementsByTagName("tag")` → HTMLCollection  
  - `querySelector("selector")` → first match  
  - `querySelectorAll("selector")` → NodeList of all matches  
- Modify content:
  - `element.textContent` → text inside element  
  - `element.innerHTML` → HTML inside element  
  - `element.innerText` → visible text  
- Modify attributes:
  - `element.setAttribute("attr", "value")`  
  - `element.getAttribute("attr")`  
  - `element.removeAttribute("attr")`  
- Style elements:
  - `element.style.property = "value"`  
- Classes:
  - `element.classList.add("class")`  
  - `element.classList.remove("class")`  
  - `element.classList.toggle("class")`  
- Create & remove elements:
  - `document.createElement("tag")`  
  - `parent.appendChild(child)`  
  - `parent.removeChild(child)`  
- Events:
  - `element.addEventListener("event", callback)`  
  - `onclick`, `onmouseover`, `onchange` as shortcuts  
- DOM traversal:
  - `parentNode`, `childNodes`, `firstChild`, `lastChild`, `nextSibling`, `previousSibling`  
- Forms & inputs:
  - `input.value` → get/set input value  
  - Validate or manipulate input dynamically
